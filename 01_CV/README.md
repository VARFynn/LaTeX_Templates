For inquiries or assistance, please feel free to contact me at VARFynn@gmail.com.

## 1. Preamble (Customizable)

The preamble explains the document's main properties and provides customization options with basic LaTeX knowledge. It also defines the functions used throughout the document, allowing for easy adjustments.

## 2. Content (Optional Customization)

The template provides flexibility in customizing the content:

- **Personal Information**: You are supposed to adjust your personal information. I left it intentionally in code form s.t. you can easily adjust it according to your preferences (e.g. no LinkedIn).

- **Entry Structure**:
   - Use `\NameDate{}{}` to input your name and date.
   - Choose between `\JobtitleNoBullets{}{}` for entries without bullets, and `\Jobtitle{}{}` for entries with bullets.
   - Select the appropriate number of bullets with `\onebullets{}`, `\twobullets{}{}`, or `\threebullets{}{}{}`. Avoid using more than three bullets per entry. (Adjust spacing in the code in section 1.3 if needed.)

- **Additional Information**: Fill in additional details in the table format. You can customize the rows based on your requirements. If you plan to make any page-related changes in the preamble, remember to adjust the table size accordingly.
