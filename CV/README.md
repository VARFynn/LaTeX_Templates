# CV Template (Business CV) 

This is a template for a business cv, usually used in consulting or in industry. 

In case of any questions: VARFynn@gmail.com

The template is structured in the following way: 

## 1. Preamble 
The main properties of the document are explained, and can with some tex knowlede be customized. Additionally, the further used functions are defined here. 

## 2. Content 
Here the previous defined functions are filled with your content. 


However, it's somewhat important, that after you you have added the content, you adjust the size at the marked lines (not only page size) s.t. the page is fully filled. It's also important to differentiate between career stops with bullets and without (w.r.t. the spacing - examples for both a are given in the template).
